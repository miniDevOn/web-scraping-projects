## About the Project
This repository has a collection of web scraping projects. I attempted to scrape many websites in order to cope with various structures and obtain various sorts of data (cars, salary, sports...). Some of these projects feature crawling techniques as well as exploratory data visualization. I'd also like to point out that the web isn't constant, thus the method I approach a specific website scraping now may not be appropriate in the future.

I recommend starting with the notebook that scrapes movie data from <a href=''>Cineb.com</a> since it provides an understanding of how the scraping is done.
